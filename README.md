# dora-openarm-quitter

A [Dora](https://dora-rs.ai/) node that exits when it receives a `quit` command.

## Usage

This node exists just for quitting looping dora-rs dataflow smoothly. Dora-rs nodes in dataflow quit when all input nodes are quit. This dora-node can quit by `command{data=[quit]}` input. For example, [dora-openarm-data-collection-ui](https://github.com/enactic/dora-openarm-data-collection-ui) outputs `command{data=[quit]}`. If this does-rs node receives `command{data=[quit]}`, this dora-rs node quit by itself. Other dora-rs nodes that use this dora-rs node as input are also quit after this dora-rs node quit.

See also [enactic/dora-openarm-data-collection](github.com/enactic/dora-openarm-data-collection) how to use this dora-rs node.
